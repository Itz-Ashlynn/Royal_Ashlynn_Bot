## User Data Security Notice
We take user data security seriously—after all, it’s our top priority. But let’s be real: we’re only human, and we’re not infallible.
However, rest assured that all your chats, commands, and interactions with the bot are secure and kept private by Telegram’s servers. 
If you're still worried about your privacy, then maybe it's best to stop using the bot. Your peace of mind matters, and we respect that.


## Contact Us for Data Security Concerns
If you have still any questions or concerns, please follow the guidelines below to get in touch with us. 
Even if you're unsure whether your issue relates to data security, we encourage you to reach out. We're here to help!

## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities, as GitHub issues are publicly accessible!**

Instead, contact us per mail (aarabhofficial@pm.me).
We guarantee a response within seven workdays and a security patch as fast as possible.

Thanks for your cooperation and your understanding.
